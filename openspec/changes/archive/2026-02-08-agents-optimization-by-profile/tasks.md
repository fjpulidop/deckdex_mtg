## 1. Scoped AGENTS.md files

- [x] 1.1 Create `backend/AGENTS.md` with overview, commands, file map, and conventions for the API (FastAPI)
- [x] 1.2 Create `frontend/AGENTS.md` with overview, commands, file map, and conventions for the web app (React, TypeScript, Vite)
- [x] 1.3 Create `deckdex/AGENTS.md` with overview, file map, and conventions for the core package (processor, storage, config)

## 2. Root AGENTS.md refactor

- [x] 2.1 Add precedence rule at the top of root AGENTS.md ("closest AGENTS.md wins; root holds global defaults only")
- [x] 2.2 Add "Index of scoped AGENTS.md" section listing backend, frontend, and deckdex with brief descriptions
- [x] 2.3 Ensure root does not duplicate stack-specific content (commands, file maps, golden samples); keep skills and workflow
