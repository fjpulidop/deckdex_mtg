<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START setup -->
## Setup & environment
- Install dev dependencies before running tests
- Some tests may require additional setup (see individual test files)
- Use the project's test framework consistently

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START organization -->
## Test organization
- Group tests by feature or module
- Name test files to match source files (e.g., `foo_test.go`, `foo.test.ts`)
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Keep fixtures and mocks in dedicated directories
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END organization -->

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START code-style -->
## Code style & conventions
- One assertion per test when possible
- Use descriptive test names: `test_should_return_error_when_input_is_empty`
- Avoid testing implementation details; focus on behavior
- Keep tests independent - no shared mutable state
- Mock external dependencies (network, filesystem, time)
- Use table-driven tests for multiple similar cases
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END code-style -->

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START security -->
## Security & safety
- Never commit real credentials in test fixtures
- Use environment variables or mock services for sensitive data
- Sanitize any test data that might contain PII
- Ensure test databases are isolated from production
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END security -->

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START checklist -->
## PR/commit checklist
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] New functionality has corresponding tests
- [ ] Test names describe expected behavior
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data
- [ ] Mocks are appropriate and maintainable
- [ ] Coverage hasn't decreased significantly

## Patterns to Follow
> **Prefer looking at real code in this repo over generic examples.**
> See **Golden Samples** section above for files that demonstrate correct patterns.
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END examples -->

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START help -->
## When stuck
- Check existing tests for patterns
- Review test framework documentation
- Ensure test isolation (no shared state)
- Check root AGENTS.md for project conventions
