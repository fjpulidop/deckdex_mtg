<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START setup -->
## Setup & environment
- Examples should be self-contained and runnable
- Each example may have its own dependencies (check local README)
- Examples should work with the current version of the main package
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END setup -->

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START commands -->
## Running examples
- Check each example's README for specific instructions
- Most examples: `cd example-name && follow README`
- Some examples may require environment setup
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END commands -->

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START organization -->
## Example organization
- One directory per example/use case
- Each example has its own README explaining what it demonstrates
- Keep examples focused on one concept or pattern
- Name examples descriptively: `basic-usage/`, `advanced-config/`, `integration-with-x/`
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END organization -->

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START code-style -->
## Code style & conventions
- Examples should be educational and well-commented
- Use realistic but simplified scenarios
- Show best practices, not shortcuts
- Include error handling to demonstrate proper patterns
- Keep examples minimal - only what's needed to demonstrate the concept
- Avoid complex setups that distract from the main point
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END code-style -->

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START documentation -->
## Documentation requirements
- Each example needs a README with:
  - What this example demonstrates
  - Prerequisites and setup steps
  - How to run the example
  - Expected output or behavior
  - Links to relevant documentation
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END documentation -->

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START security -->
## Security & safety
- Never include real API keys or credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive config: `export API_KEY=your-key`
- Use sandbox/test environments when interacting with external services
- Include warnings for examples that make real API calls
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END security -->

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START checklist -->
## PR/commit checklist
- [ ] Example runs successfully
- [ ] README is complete and accurate
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Code demonstrates best practices
- [ ] Comments explain non-obvious parts
- [ ] Example works with current package version
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END checklist -->

## Patterns to Follow
> **Prefer looking at real code in this repo over generic examples.**
> See **Golden Samples** section above for files that demonstrate correct patterns.
<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:END examples -->

<!-- AGENTS-GENERATED:START help -->
## When stuck
- Check similar examples for patterns
- Ensure the example is self-contained
- Test the example from scratch (fresh environment)
- Check root AGENTS.md for project conventions
